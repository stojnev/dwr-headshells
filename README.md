# dŵr headshells

"dŵr headshells" is a collection of 3D models of common and uncommon headshells, ready for 3D execution.

## Description

Headshells are a crucial element of the cartridge / tonearm coupling, specifically with tonearms that feature bayonet connectors. As such, they influence the interface directly with both geometry and materials used.

This repo is a collection of 3D models of existing headshells, and provided solely for educational use.

## Methodology

Every headshell model is located within an appropriately titled folder, usually denoting the actual model name / number of said headshell. Where applicable, each folder contains separate subfolders to provide headshells with or without an integrated connector.

The majority of commercial headshells are manufactured to provide for the integration of a separate connector, readily available. Some models come with an integrated connector, and for most of the models provided here, I have provided said option as well. Theoretically, the integrated connector should provide for superior rigidity and less strain on the interface.

## Manufacturing

For every model, STP and STL files are provided, so that the headshells can he either CNC machined or 3D printed.

For the models with an integrated connector, you would need to provide the actual connecting pins (rods).

For the models that do not feature an integrated connector, you would need to provide the full connector. This approach is easier to implement, although it may suffer from decreased rigidity.
